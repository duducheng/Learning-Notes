## 2020-06
There is time with no updating the repo... I will restart it.

I got one more (co-first authored) paper accepted by MICCAI'20, which results in 4 totally. How lucky!

* [x] Deep Learning Based Rib Centerline Extraction and Labeling ([MICCAI'18 MSKI 2018 Workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07082)): it is in fact a very interesting paper, although towards small audience. Solid methods (although not elegant with lots of hand-crafted "engineering"), good results. It deserves a better publication venue and more citation if presented with good story. The authors seem to assume the audience to have much background in chest CT image analysis.
* [x] X3D: Expanding Architectures for Efficient Video Recognition ([CVPR'20 oral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04730)): a good paper with solid results. Straightforward method: simple and compact basis network to expand in terms of temporal, spatial, network width and depth, etc., just like EfficientNet for videos. However, the writing is somehow misleading in certain words (although it is better to understand with the supplementary materials). There is also typos (I read the arXiv version).

* [x] Embracing Imperfect Datasets: A Review of Deep Learning Solutions for Medical Image Segmentation ([MedIA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10454)): a systematic review for scarce and weak annotations. Good to relate the methods, but seems not surprising for me. PS: it is very long (30+ pages).

  * [x] Elastic Boundary Projection for 3D Medical Imaging Segmentation ([CVPR'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00518)): it is still 2D segmentation, while iteratively. Only eligible for segmentation task. The inference speed should be very low. Now aplicable for irregular geometric shape. The whole idea is very related to shape modeling / human-in-the-loop segmentation.
  * [x] Models Genesis: Generic Autodidactic Models for 3D Medical Image Analysis ([MICCAI'19](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/models-genesis-generic-autodidactic-models)): self-supervised learning on MIC.
  * [x] Med3D: Transfer Learning for 3D Medical Image Analysis ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00625)) ([code](https://github.com/Tencent/MedicalNet)): easy but useful. Better carefully using.

However, the authors make the idea work, by making the initial base vectors independent on data, while dependent on dataset. I think it is the key.

## 2019-08
Work hard for T-PAMI and CVPR!!!!


### Reading
* Medical
  * [x] End-to-end lung cancer screening with three-dimensional deep learning on low-dose chest computed tomography ([Nat Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0447-x)): train existing methods on NLST, on healthy (95%+)patients without intermediate results (complete detection results). It is not real world. It is not practical indeed (only produce final diagnosis, with very limited intermediate outputs).
  * [x] Signet Ring Cell Detection With a Semi-supervised Learning Framework ([IPMI'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03954))
  * [x] Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look for the  ([MIDL'18](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Skft7cijM))

It does not well leverage the classification and uncertainty prediction task (joint training drops the performance). Anyway, it is not easy to follow, thus I did not read all the experiment part.

It hard encodes many engineering tricks. I suppose it to be the MICCAI'19 best paper. 
  * [x] A large annotated medical image dataset for the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09063)): an awesome study towards medical AutoML, a Nature-level dataset preparation, maybe submit to Nature Machine Intelligence?

  * [x] Predictive Uncertainty Estimation via Prior Networks ([NeurIPS'18](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7936-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-via-prior-networks.pdf)): also insightful.

Poorly writen in some sections, but overall good. It also proposes a Dirichlet Prior approach over categorial distribution, which I previously have a similar idea with. The experiments are limited.

## 2019-04

A terrible month. Mass. It sounds good: I have submited papers to MICCAI'19 and ACM MM, and a paper was accepted by Cancer Medicine. However, my research have little progress indeed. Besides I spent too much time on games (especially `The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild` :) ). I need focus. For further plan, I need more inputs. Only by this I can go further. Bravo, Jiancheng!

### Reading
* Graph Neural Networks
  * [x] How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks? ([ICLR'19](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryGs6iA5Km)): very good paper, intuitive, insightful. But writing is not great enough. Maybe just because there are many "not such systematic" ideas in this paper.

## 2019-02
* During Spring Festival, it was a busy time for CVPR'19 rebuttal. Luckily, 1 of 3 first-author submissions of mine was accepted to CVPR'19! 
* I then traveled to Thailand and HK. It was a busy month yet with few paper reading.

### Reading
* Adversarial Robustness
  * [x] Boosting Adversarial Attacks with Momentum ([CVPR'18](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Dong_Boosting_Adversarial_Attacks_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)): though simple, it is incretibly effective. The writing of the paper is great. Well motivated. Insightful. NIPS2017 AdvExp chanllenge winners of two tracks (untargeted and targeted attack).
  * [x] Mitigating Adversarial Effects Through Randomization ([ICLR'18](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk9yuql0Z)): bypassed by Obfuscated Gradient paper. Good to read the challenge setting.
* [x] Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent ([NIPS'16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474)): good insight on learning to learn. Besides, new insights for me, apart from the models and algorithms, are that we can use any value for backprop! Even for a value that is not in a same computation graph! It's actually very straighforward, but very difficult to get it for the first time.
* [x] Do Deep Generative Models Know What They Don't Know? ([ICLR'19](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xwNhCcYm)): OoD samples can have higher likelihood for generative models (emphasis on flow). However, it seems that anomaly detection is still applicable?

  * [ ] Week 3: Ultrasound

### Reading
* [x] A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images ([NIPS'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05034)) (code: [official re-implementation (TensorFlow)](https://github.com/SimonKohl/probabilistic_unet), [PyTorch](https://github.com/stefanknegt/probabilistic_unet_pytorch))
* [x] Snapshot Ensembles: Train 1, get M for free ([ICLR'17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00109)): not so effective, but consine learning rate seems potential. 
* [x] Piggyback: Adapting a Single Network to Multiple Tasks by Learning to Mask Weights ([ECCV'18](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Arun_Mallya_Piggyback_Adapting_a_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)): very inspiring.
* Videos
  * [x] Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset ([CVPR'17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750)) ([code](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d)): a.k.a. I3D
  * [x] Can Spatiotemporal 3D CNNs Retrace the History of 2D CNNs and ImageNet? ([CVPR'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09577)) ([code](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch)): seems very limited novelty, but may be good to use.
* Dynamic Networks
  * [x] DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search ([ICLR'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055)) ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1eYHoC5FX) disputed): interesting paper, inspiring, validation dataset is also possible for (iteractive) optimization.
  * [x] Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268)): a.k.a. ENAS. 
    * *NB*: Read DARTS and ENAS, it's easy to find these two are highly related. Lots of contributions are proposed by ENAS (or even before?). The experiment settings of DARTS are borrowed much from ENAS. A basic assumption of DARTS is the weight sharing (which is the key contribution of ENAS). DARTS provides an alternative to optimize the networks: ENAS uses RL (with controller LSTM), and DARTS use a soft weights. A single forward for ENAS is just a network, while for DARTS it is an "ensemble" of networks. For experiments, ENAS seems more efficient, though the controller LSTM get gradients with high variance. For me, I prefer ENAS way (just like neural turing machine), while DARTS is clearly easier to implement. The [Switchable Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10779) is inspired from / could be viewed as variant of DARTS.  
  * [x] Decoupled Neural Interfaces Using Synthetic Gradients ([ICML17](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/jaderberg17a/jaderberg17a.pdf)) ([DeepMind blog](https://deepmind.com/blog/decoupled-neural-networks-using-synthetic-gradients/)): the blog is great for illustration.
  * [x] A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and Go through self-play ([Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140)): many details missing in the context. AlphaGO, AlphaGO Zero paper and supplementary are also needed to implement (though it is so large a project...). For example, the networks are presented in AlphaGO Zero paper. The reward is not detailed in AlphaZero paper as well.
  * [x] Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context ([ICLR'19 rejected](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860)): on language modeling, not on seq2seq task. Some "memory"-like improvements. Impressive results, but seems not easy to transfer to more realistic seq2seq task (like NMT). 
  * [x] GLoMo: Unsupervisedly Learned Relational Graphs as Transferable Representations ([NIPS'18]): transfer learned graph (element relations) only, rather than directly transfer features / networks. While it seems very tricky instead.
  * [x] Watch Your Step: Learning Node Embeddings via Graph Attention ([NIPS'18](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8131-watch-your-step-learning-node-embeddings-via-graph-attention.pdf)): use attention in embedding learning, rather than inference, to dynamically determine the feature horizon. I missed some details on graph embeddings.
  * [x] Slimmable Neural Networks ([ICLR'19](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gMCsAqY7))
  * [x] Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling ([NIPS'18](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7729-hierarchical-graph-representation-learning-with-differentiable-pooling))

  * [x] Learning Category-Specific Mesh Reconstruction from Image Collections ([ECCV18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07549)) ([project page](https://akanazawa.github.io/cmr/))
  * [x] Realistic Adversarial Examples in 3D Meshes ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJfcrn0qKX): ICLR19 withdraw): it is indeed very creative, while it was done in a rush. Pitfalls: single-viewpoint issues and the paper writing.
  * [x] Strike (with) a Pose: Neural Networks Are Easily Fooled by Strange Poses of Familiar Objects ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11553))
  * [x] Unsupervised Learning of Shape and Pose with Differentiable Point Clouds ([NIPS18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09381)): Very interesting paper, it is not only a point cloud version of neural mesh renderer! It also talks about the camera pose estimation, with joint training, and an ensemble distillation without a REINFORCE-based method able to optimize! Very interesting!


## 2018-12

Fortunately, IPMI19 ddl is extended to Dec 13. Then I'm preparing one another MIC journal paper.

Note the MTL is not end-to-end. It is not convincing in a cross-validation setting.
  * [x] Joint Learning for Pulmonary Nodule Segmentation, Attributes and Malignancy Prediction ([ISBI18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03584)): it uses different accuracy defination. Very engineering-orient methodology, however not detailed and convincing.
  * [x] In Silico Labeling: Predicting Fluorescent Labels in Unlabeled Images ([Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30364-7)): a very inspiring work.

Study hard! 
  * [x] fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08839)) ([code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI)): "self-contained" paper, nice dataset, the community needs more like this.

  * [x] Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds ([ICML2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02392)): apart from the GAN for point cloud, the metric to measure two point clouds is also useful (togethor with its [code](https://github.com/optas/latent_3d_points)). A paper solid to win (8-page supplementary experiments).
  * [x] PointGrid: A Deep Network for 3D Shape Understanding ([CVPR2018](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Le_PointGrid_A_Deep_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)): a simple yet effective and efficient solution for point cloud. I do like this paper (though not very well-wrtien). However, it seems a purified methodology version of VoxelNet (also CVPR2018). No cross citation between these two papers.
  * [x] VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection ([CVPR2018](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/CameraReady/3333.pdf)): a "PointGrid" (CVPR2018 as well) on kitti, better writen. No cross citation between these two papers.
  * [x] PointGrow: Autoregressively Learned Point Cloud Generation with Self-Attention ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1eWW2RqFX), ICLR2019 under review): not very clear writen.

A Hyperblic space embedding seems appealing; However, it seems that this paper does not well explained why it is suitable for attention instead of general neural network representation.

### 2018-09

Our paper `3D Deep Learning from CT Scans Predicts Tumor Invasiveness of Subcentimeter Pulmonary Adenocarcinomas` is accepted by  *[Cancer Research](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2018/10/02/0008-5472.CAN-18-0696)* (DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0696).

### Reading
* 3D Vision
  * [ ] Spherical CNNs ([ICLR2018 best](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkbd5xZRb)): this paper is too complicated for me to understand :(
  * [x] Spherical convolutions and their application in molecular modelling ([NIPS2017](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6935-spherical-convolutions-and-their-application-in-molecular-modelling)): difficult to read for non-native Engish. A good illustration for cubed-sphere grid ([link](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/cubed_sphere/CubeSphere_step-by-step.html)).
  * [x] Escape from Cells: Deep Kd-Networks for the Recognition of 3D Point Cloud Models ([ICCV2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01222))
  * [x] SO-Net: Self-Organizing Network for Point Cloud Analysis ([CVPR2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04249)): basically a PointNet++ with "SOM" clustering.
  * [x] SPLATNet: Sparse Lattice Networks for Point Cloud Processing ([CVPR2018 oral](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08275)): it uses differentiable projection to regular grids (permutohedral lattices), together with sparse convolution for efficiency. However, I have not understood its advantage over set-based networks (e.g., PointNet++). Partial reasons are that I have not understood the advantage of bilateral convolution layer (BCL).
  * [x] Neural 3D Mesh Renderer ([CVPR2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07566)) ([project page](http://hiroharu-kato.com/projects_en/neural_renderer.html))
    - *NB*: very fancy, very useful, but I have not fully understood the graphics-heavy work. I will renew my understanding further. tl;dr: 3 kinds of parameters can be optimized. `vertices`: [n_vertices, 3 (XYZ)], `textures` [n_faces, texture_size, texture_size, texture_size, 3 (RGB)], and `camera_position` [3]. Besides, `faces` [n_faces, 3 (triangle)] indicates the link of vertices (3 vs make a face), which makes the mesh can be processed like graph (it's graph indeed). `faces` seems can not be diff. The paper uses a Straight-Through Estimator to provide the gradients (for the vertices only, not sure at present; the others should have gradients naturally). 
  * [x] Generating 3D Adversarial Point Clouds ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07016)): poorly written.
  * [x] Mining Point Cloud Local Structures by Kernel Correlation and Graph Pooling ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06760)): not very insightful. Trivial modification uses too much language. Limited empirical improvements. However, learning visible (point) kernel is a good idea for interpretability in deep pc learning (which needs more exploration further).
  * [x] Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images ([ECCV2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01654)): though appealing, it needs 3D supervision, which is very different from N3MR.
* [x] Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318)): simple yet effective.
* [x] Spectral Normalization Explained ([paper: ICLR2018](https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1QRgziT-)) ([blog](https://christiancosgrove.com/blog/2018/01/04/spectral-normalization-explained.html)): greatly explained. SN means a $W/\sigma(W)$, $\sigma(W)$ denotes the max eigen vector of $W$. Then it provides a simple way to lower the computation.
* [x] Generative adversarial interpolative autoencoding: adversarial training on latent space interpolations encourage convex latent distributions ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06650)): an interesting paper, though intuitive.
* [x] Analyzing Inverse Problems with Invertible Neural Networks ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04730)): poorly written, hard to read.
* [x] Image Transformer ([ICML2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751)): self-attention application to autoregressive models.
* [x] Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations ([NAACL2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02155)): a short paper, but provides good insight: instead of using pre-defined absolute postion-encoding, it uses learnable relative position embeddings. 
* [x] Universal Transformers ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03819)): just a simple modification: add recurrence in Transformers (i.e. sharing weights for multiple layers), plus a trivial ACT (just like my setting in the code ...)
* [x] A radiomics approach to assess tumour-infiltrating CD8 cells and response to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy: an imaging biomarker, retrospective multicohort study ([LANCET Oncology](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30413-3/fulltext)): excellent angle on the usage of radiomics, though methodology is simple, the study is very meaningful and promising. 
* [x] Obfuscated Gradients Give a False Sense of Security: Circumventing Defenses to Adversarial Examples ([ICML2018 best paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420))
  - *NB*: a brilliant conference paper like a journal paper (a research article, a review and a comment paper). Well-writen, comprehensive, well-performing. Very insightful. All the 8 pages are very worth reading. However, its journal version could be better (if it exists further), since some techniques proposed seem not well suited in its Case Study section, e.g., the Reparameterization for solving Vanisihing & Exploding Gradients seems not to appear; instead, it was solved by BPDA. Besides, I don't understand why LID appears in the "Gradient Shattering" section, let alone that LID was not circumbented by the 3 main attack techniques proposed. Overall, the paper developped a good story about 3 shields (Shattered Gradients, Stochastic Gradients and Exploding & Vanishing Gradients) and 3 swords (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation BPDA, Expectation over Transformation EOT and Reparameterization), while one should be very cafeful that the shields & swords are not the whole of the paper. The comments in the discussion are also valuable for future studies.
* [x] Virtual Adversarial Training: A Regularization Method for Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning ([ICLR2016 -> T-PAMI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03976)):
  - *NB*: good empirical results, elegant solutions. 3 Hyper-parameters: `eplison` (default: 8.0, norm length for (virtual) adversarial training), `num_power_iterations` or `K` (default: 1, the number of power iterations) and `xi` (default: 1e-6, small constant for finite difference). A clean PyTorch implementation [here](https://github.com/lyakaap/VAT-pytorch) but seems with wrong default hyper-p. For the VAT loss only, it needs `K+2` forwards, and `K+1` backwards (my calc is sightly different from the paper).

  - 1) variable-length inputs can be also processed in "attention": softmax(KT.dot(Q)).dot(V) => fix size `d`
  - 2) seq2seq is indeed `encoder output` + `decoder scoring per step`! Can be parallel implemented with masking (seems to come from conv seq2seq?)
  - 3) RNN / Conv architecture can still be used, espeically in decoder

  * [Restricted Boltzmann Machines](weekly/rbm.pdf)
* Recurrent Dropout without Memory Loss ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05118))
  * *NB*: simple, implemented in TensorFlow. It archieves similar (if not better) results in LSTMs than Gal 2015. In short, it drops the recurrent updates but not the recurrent connections, it allows per-step dropout. Moon et al. 2015 drop the recurrent update and connections, with per-sequence dropout, which allows long-term learning but forget the long-term memory in inference.

* [Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks](notes/viz_rnn.md) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02078))
* Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction ([CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15782-f06/slides/timeseries.pdf)): super old lecture, even not covering LSTM. While still useful, especially it talks many concepts of time series analysis in engineering guys' eyes (rather than statstician's), though some of them are too "Digital Signal Processing" that make my undergraduate "Signal & System" concepts revive :)
* Dynamic Time Wrapping
  * *NB*: Yet another example of dynamic programming in sequence modeling, I think CTC's idea benifits from DTW (and absolutely HMM).
  * K Nearest Neighbors & Dynamic Time Warping ([code](https://github.com/markdregan/K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-Dynamic-Time-Warping)): clean code, using DTW and kNN for Human Activity Recognition. It clearly shows the esential idea of DTW, and the code is well factored. But something funny is that, in this code, not all the imports are valid, you should import something manualy before running the code.
  * Everything you know about Dynamic Time Warping is Wrong ([link](http://wearables.cc.gatech.edu/paper_of_week/DTW_myths.pdf)): gives some highlights of using and researching DTW (about 10 years ago 😐). The wording of this paper is very sharp. 3 chaims: 1) fix length doesn't hurt 2) narrow band doesn't hurt 3) speeding up DTW with tight lower bound is pointless.
* MC and MCMC from Probabilistic Graphical Models Eric Xing ([CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-14/lecture.html)): Lecture 16-18.
  * *NB*: great review for sampling based inference. MC: naive, rejection sampling, importance sampling. MCMC: Metropolis-Hasting, Gibbs, collapsed (Rao-Blackwellised) Gibbs, slice sampling, Reversible Jump MCMC (RJMCMC). RJMCMC is really non-trivial, which I didn't fully understand. It's a MCMC to jump among models' space, designed without detailed balance, while stationary.
* Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers ([link](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)) ([code](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers))

* Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)): simple math but full of brilliant ideas and tricks. ([code](https://gist.github.com/tomokishii/0ce3bdac1588b5cca9fa5fbdf6e1c412): good demenstration of using "global" moment and `ewa`)
* Layer Normalization ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450)): even simpler principle, good for RNN but, worse than BN for CNN.
* [Phased LSTM: Accelerating Recurrent Network Training for Long or Event-based Sequences](notes/plstm.md) ([NIPS](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6310-phased-lstm-accelerating-recurrent-network-training-for-long-or-event-based-sequences.pdf)) (TensorFlow [implement](https://github.com/Enny1991/PLSTM), Keras [implement](https://github.com/fferroni/PhasedLSTM-Keras), both good and clear.)
* Using Fast Weights to Attend to the Recent Past ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06258)) (TensorFlow [implement](https://github.com/ajarai/fast-weights)): Very simple math, and easy enough to implement, but it seems lots of physiology background. This paper is another trial aimed to beat LSTM. Fast weights (`FW`) based on IRNN, works well on the mentioned task. The `FW` can be regarded as something to be "memorised" during the step update. I found papers of Hinton are usually recondite. (maybe Canadian English?)
* Neural Networks for Machine Learning by Geoffrey Hinton ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/)): Finally finished. Good review for neural network approaches. Absolutely not a first course. It's a very course that can inspire you a lot if you've already known; but if you haven't known something mentioned in the course, it can be very hard for you to fully understand without other materials.

## 2017-02
Reprise from the Spring Festival 😐
* A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00019))
  * *NB*: there is not any new insight, while good to reflash some idea; it talks about vanilla RNN, LSTM, BRNN and a little bit NTM, and introduce some application, with emphasis on NLP.
* [Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling Unsegmented Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks](notes/ctc.md) ([ICML](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf))
* Bootstrap Methods for Time Series ([link](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/0a/Kreiss_and_lahiri.pdf))
  * *NB*: Though the article regards itself as a simple intro, it seems too theoretical for me. It provides some good review of bootstrap for time series, remember 1. generate series for AR like model; 2. block bootstrap; 3. markov chain bootstrap; 4. frequency domain by DFT 5. other mixtures.
* Hidden Markov Model
  * Markov model and HMM by mathematicalmonk ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGdE2AK_MQ&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA&index=95)): covering forward-backward and Viterbi.

* MCMC by mathematicalmonk ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGdE2AK_MQ&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA&index=95)): covering ergodic theorem and Metropolis, very gentle and intuitive.
* Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers ([code](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers))
  * *NB*: Great book, about practical Bayesian modeling and PyMC3.
* Variation Inference from Probabilistic Graphical Models Eric Xing ([CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-14/lecture.html)): Lecture 13-15.
  * *NB*: really good (somehow advanced) introduction to VI: loopy belief Propagation, mean field approximation, and general variational principles (solve problem in optimization fashion with dual form of function). The principles part is really abstract, but at least I got the idea. A brief to LDA is also presented in Lecture 15.
* Bayesian optimization by Nando de Freitas ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz3D36VXefI))
  * *NB*: Great intro to Bayesian opt, in 10 minutes you get the whole picture, and the rest tells some details.

Anyway, good introduction to ARIMA, GARCH, Kalman Filter and HMM on Time Series.
