**Update 2021-04-13**: I will no longer update my reading list regularly (see [`Archives`](#archives)), since now many reading materials of mine are not good to share publicly (e.g., conference / journal reviews). Besides, I only skim papers in most cases now, which makes it annoying to record everything using git. However, I will still share notes / Chinese videos on some really interesting papers.
